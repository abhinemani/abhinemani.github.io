In theory each sub-bullet would a class with 5–6, hour-long lectures/modules with quizzes attached to each module. This should lead to about 30+ courses students can mix and match, with faculty approval, for their certification in a bespoke \*program\* — eg data architect, digital services designer, etc — or they can just individual courses credits and are welcome to pick and choose.
