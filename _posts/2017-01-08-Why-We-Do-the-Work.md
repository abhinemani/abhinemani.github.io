With the cacophony, animosity, and distrust surrounding our politics at the moment, it is easy for those of us who [work within government](https://medium.comyou-wouldnt-understand-because-you-re-not-actually-a-public-servant-61701729c6ad) to lose morale, let alone hope. [Much has been written](https://medium.com/@pahlkadot/would-you-work-for-trump-edf32662107c) about the internal tensions many in the federal government, working tirelessly to modernize its operating system, feel around the new administration and its attendant personalities.
