CivicPulse is a non-profit generating data-driven, academically rigorous local government surveys through unprecedented engagement with over 200K+ local leaders themselves. Applying cutting-edge statistical modeling, CP’s reports offer a rare look into what local officials really think. And not just the handful of big cities, but all (20K+) of them… 

This is a latest report on city leadership IT priorities moving beyond the pandemic with some interesting results (this is not just CTOs/CIOs, but city managers/electeds/dept managers, etc): 

* Cybersecurity is the highest IT priority: 60% of local leaders mention security as a strategic IT priority, even higher than infrastructure modernization (50%) and citizen experience (48%).
* Big cities, in particular, place a premium on citizen experience (#2 top priority) 
* Staffing IT is not a priority. Local governments of all sizes rank staffing/recruitment as their lowest priority among IT-related initiatives, with only 14% indicating this as a strategic priority.
* IT Budgets on the rise (generally): 65% of large (>75k) and 63% of medium-sized local governments (10-75k) expect to increase their IT spending in 2022, while 64% of small local governments (<10k) expect their spending to remain the same.
