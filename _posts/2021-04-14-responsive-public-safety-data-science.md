## Technology to Restore Trust in Public Safety agencies.

Which starts with listening and responding... Over the past 3 yeras, I haveI partnered with [SPIDRTech](https://spidrtech.com), then [POLCO](https://polco.us), which [has partnered](https://blog.polco.us/polco-guardian-alliance-technologies-announce-partnership) with [Guardian Alliance](https://guardianalliancetechnologies.com/), and then [ZenCity](https://zencity.io), which acquired [ELUCD](https://ELUCD.com). 

## The confluence of Sentiment Analysis and Public Safety
Stepping back, however, we can see how these have come together as distinct but connected approaches to responsiveness — which indeed suggests a broader trend: the evolution of general tools like surveys and social media analysis for deeper engagement and insight for specific, high profile agencies in key areas, such as police departments and law enforcement generallly.

More to the point, as govtech startups  go deeper into a public sector vertical (e.g., law enforcement) opportunties to use more general horizontal government or private sector approaches will emerge. These opportunties should be product or strategy decisions for exisitng players and a guidestar for new entreprenuers. 

Over the next few week, I will be exploring the approaches from each of these innovative companies. Stay tuned. For now, more resources below:
