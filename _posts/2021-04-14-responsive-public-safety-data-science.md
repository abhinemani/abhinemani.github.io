Which starts with listening and responding... Over the past 3 yeras, I haveI partnered with [SPIDRTech](https://spidrtech.com), then [POLCO](https://polco.us), which [has partnered](https://blog.polco.us/polco-guardian-alliance-technologies-announce-partnership) with [Guardian Alliance](https://guardianalliancetechnologies.com/), and then [ZenCity](https://zencity.io), which acquired [ELUCD](https://ELUCD.com).
