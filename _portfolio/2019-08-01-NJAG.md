In 2019, the Laura and John Arnold Foundation asked for help for the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office (AG) to modernize its collection, aggregation, and publication of law enforcement (LE) use of force data. This undertaking is large in scope — covering the entire state and over 500 law enforcement agencies — but seemingly simple in need: better data collection. 

Complexities arose, however, when navigating the various different systems (both technical and human) in place, working with limited state funding, and designing a sustainable and scalable solution (ie a collection mechanism that could be reused for other LE data). 

Eventually the key deliverables were a list of civic-oriented data collection and workflow solutions and a reverse RFP — a statement of goals, not features — for SaaS vendors to compete against.
