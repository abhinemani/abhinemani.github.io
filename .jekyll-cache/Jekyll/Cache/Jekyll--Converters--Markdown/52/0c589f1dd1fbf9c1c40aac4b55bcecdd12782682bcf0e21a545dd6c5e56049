<p>I recently was asked to give a talk to <a href="https://codeformilwaukee.org/">Code for Milwaukee</a> on their first anniversary. This happened to also by <a href="https://stlresponse.org/">my 10th anniversary</a> in civic and government tech.</p>

<p>In honor of both, I put together my 5 top learnings from the last decade in the areas of technology, open data, community engagement, and service delivery.</p>

<p>A brief summary is below, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/abhinemani_5-trends-for-civictech-govtech-in-the-activity-6673753214921293824-S8j8">the full deck is available on LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<h4 id="low-code">Low Code</h4>

<p>Focus on building tools that enable non-technologists (aka â€œpoor manâ€™s hackers) to get the job done. This means building not just an appâ€Šâ€” to sayâ€Šâ€” map a set of open data, but a simple framework where anyone with enough enthusiasm could use your code to spin up their own.</p>

<p>Tools like <a href="http://jlord.us/sheetsee.js/">Jessica Lordâ€™s SheetSee.js</a> and <a href="https://derekeder.com/searchable_map_template/">Derek Ederâ€™s Map Template</a> haveâ€Šâ€” in my anecdotal reviewâ€Šâ€” proven to have far greater utility, far wider adoption, and much deeper impact than most open source civic apps.</p>

<p>Find and highlight data coming from NGOs, businesses, and universities, leveraging the governmentâ€™s role as a platform to rethink open data portals for a wider open data ecosystem.</p>

<p>The local governmentâ€™s Open Data Portal has an oftener underutilized non-technical function: it can confer trust and reliability of community-sourced data.</p>

<p>And looking forward, thereâ€™s a new breed on open data technologies that serve less as â€œspreadsheets on the internetâ€ and more as a platform, or middleware, bringing together all the data players in a â€œsmart city.â€ (<a href="https://stae.co/">Stae.co</a> is a good example of this new vision.)</p>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__zXc5RWHAbVvXPUYFEh__r7A__2x.jpeg" alt="" />

<p>Look towards enhanced regionalism for open dataâ€Šâ€”â€Šas interagency coordination becomes even more regent in a COVID Worldâ€Šâ€”â€Šremembering that residents think of their lives and problems, not the city open data portal vs the county vs the stateâ€¦</p>

<p>Not only do these regional data programsâ€Šâ€” such as those in <a href="http://www.wprdc.org/">Western Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://stldata.org/">St. Louis</a> â€” save the jurisdictions money, time, and staff time, they enable more broadly useful application development. (See the <a href="https://stlresponse.org/">STL COVID portal</a> built by the STL Alliance.)</p>

<p>Pulling these two threads togetherâ€Šâ€” community data and regional programsâ€Šâ€” we can see a new model for open data that puts the <strong>citizen experience</strong> first, first for developers and designers, first for government officials and local business, and first for the communities they all serve.</p>

<h4 id="hacks--hackersredux">Hacks &amp; HackersÂ (Redux)</h4>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__QhQIyQ5THxQDokvC87dERA__2x.jpeg" alt="" />

<p>Collaborate with local journalistsâ€Šâ€”â€Šor follow their leadâ€Šâ€”â€Šas the data rich projects both civic hacking groups and local news outlets as both share goals and limited capacity; make the whole greater than the sum of its parts.</p>

<p>These collaborations can take the form of news outlets building their own civic apps (eg the <a href="https://covid.citybureau.org/">COVID resource finder by Chicagoâ€™s City Bureau</a>), civic data scientists creating visualizations for data driven reporting, or civic-minded blogs and other publications shining a spotlight on the civic tech community.</p>

<h4 id="digital-services-asdefault">Digital Services asÂ Default</h4>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__Ni85MmU0tND99rCMEWlklw__2x.jpeg" alt="" />
undefined</p>

<p>Few cities can afford a digital services team and very few actually have the hyperbolic antiquated systems outsiders decry: most fall somewhere in the middle.</p>

<p>Recognize that in-person service delivery is harder now more than ever, and use that as an opportunity to prioritize digital service delivery.</p>

<p>Governments can leverage the host of off-the-shelf tools (such as <a href="https://citygro.ws">CityGro.ws</a>) and the internetâ€™s wonderful ability to <a href="https://medium.comsmall-city-pieces-loosely-joined-5202fb5a93e3">loosely join, small pieces</a> for a big impact.</p>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__BB__KBtgJ__8mTvq__9k3__QAQ__2x.jpeg" alt="" />
undefined</p>

<p>And in doing so, itâ€™s vital to remember that governments do not have the luxury of catering to just one demographic or user type: it has to work for all of us.</p>

<h4 id="its-up-tous">Itâ€™s up toÂ us.</h4>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__zBMRkZ03ZAumGEuoYqnw0Q__2x.jpeg" alt="" />
undefined</p>

<p>There are a myriad of projects, insights, and learnings already from how civic technologists are playing a vital role already this decade; the Coronavirus demanded it. I will defer to those on-the-ground for their more informed points of view.</p>

<p>Instead Iâ€™ll close with a line from The West Wing I canâ€™t get out of my head these days:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thereâ€™s never been a more important time to be good at what [we]Â do.</p>
