I"s<p>That’s a question I’m asked fairly often.</p>

<p>Indeed, I’m often tasked with giving an introduction on local government innovation — to new mayors, potential investors, etc — and after a couple dozen hacked together presentations, I decided to put some effort into it, and put together this document.</p>

<object data="/decks/21stCitiesPrimer.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" style="min-height: 400px;"></object>

<p>Since the definition of a “21st Century City” seems elusive, or controversial, I did what I do: tell some stories.</p>

<p>It’s a kind of “greatest hits” with simple examples and takeaways from three key areas of impact from the last few years: digital services, data science/analytics, and civic entrepreneurship. It closes with a high-level set of recommendations including policy and staffing. This way it works as a presentation or a leave behind.</p>

<p>I’ve found it helpful in various setting — conferences, pitches, and just casual conversations — so in the interest of transparency, I figured I’d share it publicly.</p>

<p>Share, comment, and critique freely.</p>
