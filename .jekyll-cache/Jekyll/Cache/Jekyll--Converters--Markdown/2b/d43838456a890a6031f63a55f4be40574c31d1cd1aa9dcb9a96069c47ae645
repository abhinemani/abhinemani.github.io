I"¿<p>That was the response I got on a call a few weeks ago whilst having a lively conversation with a member of a governmentâ€™s civil service.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>â€œYou wouldnâ€™t understand because youâ€™re not actually a public servant.â€</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At first this was tough for me to handle. I was taken aback. Iâ€™ve lived my life for governments; opting at every turn to do something for the civic and social good over my own private interests.</p>

<p>In this personâ€™s defense, indeed I am no longer a full-time staff member in a governmentâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI work with <a href="http://ethoslabs.us">multiple in an advisory or consultancy role</a>.</p>

<p>I think thatâ€™s public service.</p>

<p>I also now work with a handful of government-focused startup companiesâ€Šâ€”â€Šall of which dedicate their lives and livelihoods to helping people.</p>

<p>I think thatâ€™s public service.</p>

<p>And I also now serve on the board of a handful of nonprofits working hand-in-hand with governments and elected officialsâ€Šâ€”â€Šnot to just help <em>them</em> in the polls or elections, but in getting <em>them</em> better, deeper, and more insightful engagement with their constituencies.</p>

<p>I think thatâ€™s public service as well.</p>

<p>So I suppose I was taken aback not so much at the critique of meâ€Šâ€”â€Šindeed Iâ€™m happy to admit there are many things I donâ€™t knowâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut more of the broader implication. Arenâ€™t those advisors, consultants, and volunteers working with government, public servants; those startups optimizing governmentsâ€™ technology, public servants; and those nonprofits dedicated to improving civic life, public servants?</p>

<p>I sincerely hope so. <em>Because itâ€™d be a sad world to live in</em> where folks, ranging from the volunteers Iâ€™ve been inspired by like <a href="https://twitter.com/joelrip">Joel Riphagen</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mayagirl">Maya Wallace</a> in <a href="https://codeforsacramento.org/">Sacramento</a>, to the entrepreneurs Iâ€™ve learned from like <a href="https://twitter.com/njbowden">Nick Bowden</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/smburns?lang=en">Scott Burns</a>, in <a href="http://app.mysidewalk.com/">Kansas City</a> and <a href="http://govdelivery.com">St. Paul</a>, to the nonprofit leaders I know like <a href="https://twitter.com/seamuskraft">Seamus Kraft</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/seamuskraft">OpenGov Foundation</a>) and <a href="https://twitter.com/tiffani">Tiffani Ashley Bell</a> (HumanUtility), werenâ€™t considered public servants. They live their lives to serve the public. Thatâ€™s all that they do. When they could do much else.</p>

<p>As do so many others.</p>

<p>We need to expand our definition of public service to not just include the amazing people who sit within City Hall to those who sit on the outside, helping prop it up.</p>

<p>Because public service shouldnâ€™t just be a job description, but a job; itâ€™s something you do, wherever, and however you can.</p>
