<p>Over the past decade, I have worked with local governments in various capacities, ranging from a researcher at a think tank, to a business development lead at a tech nonprofit, to working within government itself and interacting with folks in those other roles. I’ve been on both sides of the table when it comes to public sector partnerships.</p>

<p>Now as I build out <a href="http://ethoslabs.us/">EthosLabs</a> as a resource for the growing GovTech industry, a resource to reduce friction, accelerate innovation, and quite simply make everyone’s life a little easier, I’ve taken to jotting down lessons learned from my experiences. In particular, I am trying to sketch out the pain points and workarounds for purchasing and partnerships for governments — as sticky issues such as procurement almost always come up as the barrier for innovation.</p>

<p>A friend of mine was said that was vastly overstated and if you simply knew what you were doing procurement and its cousins — budgeting, bidding, and contracting — were very much solvable problems.</p>

<p>Of course we will be putting that to the test. But first we have to know what works and what doesn’t.</p>

<p>Let’s start there, what doesn’t work.</p>

<p>I’m penning this series of posts with strategies and tactics I’ve noticed that handicap or even kneecap a GovTech salesperson when pitching to government decision-makers.</p>

<p>(It’s “1/n” as I don’t know how many we will end up with, which as also means that I’m eager for your thoughts/experiences as well.</p>

  <li><strong>Different prices for different cities</strong>: Cities talk to each other. Well, city staffers that is. Particularly in highly specialized roles, such as technology leadership (CTOs, CIOs, CDOs, etc), cross-jurisdictional collaboration is essential since many of these posts are new. There’s no playbook — and if there is one, it’s being written by the very people currently in those roles. As someone who has been there, I can attest, you are building the plane while you’re flying it. So again, either for a sounding board or even for a support group, city tech leadership talk. And particularly when it comes to vendor relations, RFPs, contracts, and critically, pricing. And finding out who someone knows is as easy as running a Linkedin search. Do your homework, and be sure you aren’t quoting a price wildly divergent than those you (or your colleagues) gave to your potential client’s peer. They will find out, and feel like they are being played.</li>
