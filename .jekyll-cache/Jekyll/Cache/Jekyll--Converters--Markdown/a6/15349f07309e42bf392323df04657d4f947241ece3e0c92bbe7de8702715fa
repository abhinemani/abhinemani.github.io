I"O<p><em>I often — like you I bet — have to make slide decks fast, very fast, and need them not to look like what I made back in the 8th grade. I’ve taken classes on slide design, made a few 1,000 myself, and I’d admit that never have I been able to quickly, easily, and reliably been able to make a professional, yet human deck in under 30 minutes. That ought to change, I think. The modern web is just too good for this to be so hard.</em></p>

<p>So here’s my pitch:</p>

<h3 id="general-principles">General Principles</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Slides should be fast and easy to create and not ever strain the eyes of your audience</li>
  <li>You should be able to create slides through just your browser and they should work everywhere and anywhere (and yes, that means you fonts)</li>
  <li>Never should there be faked 3D animation — or animation of any kind — projected by an adult.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-simple-theory-ofslides">A simple theory of slides</h3>

<p>There are basically four types of slides that you should ever really want to have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos</li>
  <li>Quotes</li>
  <li>Charts</li>
  <li>Screenshots</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="photos"><em>Photos</em></h4>

<p>Photo slides should be simple, beautiful, powerful — and most of all easy to include and optimize:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smart search from flickr, instagram, Facebook and other social image platforms for super simple starts</li>
  <li>Instagram-style and -ease filtering and cropping to add charm</li>
  <li>And automated permalinking, attribution, and short link to be a good person</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="quotes"><em>Quotes</em></h4>

<p>Quote slides should let the words do the talking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Smart search from quote websites and copy/paste functionality from websites/blogs for quick starts</li>
  <li>Big, bold, and mostly universally accessible fonts to make sure the words are heard</li>
  <li>Option for photo-slides as backgrounds to spruce them up (optional, not required)</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="charts"><em>Charts</em></h4>

<p>A charts slide should convey one point, and one point only as simply as possible; that means using chart and graph styles that people actually know and understand:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sync up with Google Sheets and then restyle with D3 and a clean CSS for beautiful, simple bar, line, and pie charts (that’s it)</li>
  <li>Smart copy/paste functionality to take Excel data into a non-Excel looking chart</li>
  <li>Only a few “process” charts (read: a vegan diet of SmartCharts): linear, hierarchy, and cycle</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="screenshots"><em>Screenshots</em></h4>

<p>Screenshot slides should be just like a screenshot: fast, easy, and reliable:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Just type in a url and automatically pull in a recent (but then archived) shot of a URL to get things going</li>
  <li>Super simple cropping and filtering functionality just like photos</li>
  <li>Stored archives of your past screenshots for posterities sake since, well, sometimes websites fail</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s go make this happen. A world of current and future procrastinating presenters will be forever at your mercy.</p>
