<p>What does a 21st century city look like?</p>

<p>Thatâ€™s a question Iâ€™m asked fairly often.</p>

<p>Indeed, Iâ€™m often tasked with giving an introduction on local government innovationâ€Šâ€”â€Što new mayors, potential investors, etcâ€Šâ€”â€Šand after a couple dozen hacked together presentations, I decided to put some effort into it, and put together this document.</p>

_technological optimist and political philosophy nerd. writer, speaker, maker. Published on A â€œ101â€ primer fromâ€¦_www2.slideshare.net</a><a href="https://www2.slideshare.net/anemani10/21st-century-cities-technology-innovation-an-overview-103000495"></a></p>

<p>Since the definition of a â€œ21st Century Cityâ€ seems elusive, or controversial, I did what I do: tell some stories.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a kind of â€œgreatest hitsâ€ with simple examples and takeaways from three key areas of impact from the last few years: digital services, data science/analytics, and civic entrepreneurship. It closes with a high-level set of recommendations including policy and staffing. This way it works as a presentation or a leave behind.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve found it helpful in various settingâ€Šâ€” conferences, pitches, and just casual conversationsâ€Šâ€” so in the interest of transparency, I figured Iâ€™d share it publicly.</p>

<p>Share, comment, and critique freely.</p>
