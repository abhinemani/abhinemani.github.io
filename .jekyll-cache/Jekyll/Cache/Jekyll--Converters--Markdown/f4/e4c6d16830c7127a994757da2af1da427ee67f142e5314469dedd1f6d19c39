I"<<p>Recently I was honored to speak at the installment of my former professor Brock Blomberg as the next president of Urnisus College. My professor taught the Economics portion of the college‚Äôs distinctive Philosophy, Politics, and Economics program‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa tutorial-based curriculum where you get a taste and a sense of the interconnections between these three key arenas of public life. Professor Blomberg was well aware that covering such deep and vast topics would be impossible in just four short years, indeed this was no triple major. Instead he recommended what he called, ‚ÄúCocktail party economics‚Äù: a daft, yet light understanding of the topic sufficient enough to impress your guests at a cocktail party with a few simple charts and graphs on a handy napkin. Enough to get by, but not too much to bore your neighbors. Sound advice. Accordingly, at his recent inaugural I used this tactic to discuss the chosen topic, ‚ÄúInnovation.‚Äù As these illustrations took far more time than anything I‚Äôve made in Keynote and Powerpoint, I figured I‚Äôd share them with a few tips on napkin writing for other kindred spirits.</p>

You can basically use to describe anything in economics with enough words and no axis._<br />
Pro-tip: use the side of a notebook to draw straight lines; it‚Äôs next to impossible to do it by freehand on a flimsy napkin._</p>

Pro-tip: use the bottom of a cup to draw the circles, and in general, never try to write words‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are illegible. Sharpies were not designed for napkin penmanship._</p>

<em>Lesson learned: Apparently using facebook as the go-to app for the college set doesn‚Äôt work that well any more. Expected a few more laughs‚Ä¶</em></p>

<em>Lesson learned: It‚Äôs nearly impossible to draw a 1 percent bar chart with a Sharpie.</em></p>

<p><img src="/post-img/1__CCi8uc4lYoAgN6vzUghlMw.jpeg" alt="" />
<em>Lesson learned: Hubs and spokes make a lot more sense with a circle drawn around them‚Ä¶</em></p>

<em>Pro-tip: Next time you think of drawing a network on a napkin, don‚Äôt.</em></p>

<em>Lesson learned: When you talk about napkins and especially when you say you should throw them away, don‚Äôt accidentally leave one on the stage floor for the next speaker. Makes the next guy‚Äôs pictures kind of awkward‚Ä¶</em></p>
