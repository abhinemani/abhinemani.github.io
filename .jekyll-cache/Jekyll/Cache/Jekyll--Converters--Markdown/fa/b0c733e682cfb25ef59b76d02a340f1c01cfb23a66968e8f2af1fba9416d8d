I"q<p>Before taking my post in Los Angeles, I took some time to study the ingredients of successful open data communities around the country; cities as small as Portland to as large as New York, and everything in between. Many models, tactics, and strategies emerged. Hack nights, app competitions, open data, challenges, investment, etc… The challenge was to distill such creativity into some guidance for a city getting off the ground with open data. Below is my working draft of the “key elements of a successful open data community” — this isn’t meant to be exhaustive or rigorous, just a high-level identification of what seemed to work, where.</p>

<p><em>(You’ll note that this isn’t rather novel, but I found that breaking it out plainly helped organize efforts as we rebooted Hack for LA in the city and encouraged new partners — within the city and outside — to join in.)</em></p>
