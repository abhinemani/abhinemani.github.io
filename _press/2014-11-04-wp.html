<blockquote>On Thursday, Los Angeles announced that it has launched what it called an "in-house venture capital fund" stocked with general city funds as part of the recently passed budget. As of now, city employees apply for an uncapped portion of the $1 million available through Innovate.LAcity.org... "People in any organization are often thinking, 'You know, I have a good idea about how to change this or that,' " says Abhi Nemani, the city's chief data officer. "But often they don't have the leadership or buy-in from their employer to get it done."
