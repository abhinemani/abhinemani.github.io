<blockquote><strong>Question:	Your vision for better government technology emphasizes not just coming up with workable solutions but also creating agile and elegant software that benefits not only the public but public servants. Could you talk about why this is important and how this relates to GIS?</strong><br />
Answer: Not only should we be creating beautiful and elegant citizen-facing solutions but also developing better tools for public servants to better serve the public: data analysis tools to prioritize service delivery, workflow systems to streamline communications, or data collection tools to speed up on-the-ground reporting, just to name a few. These are force multipliers. They enable public servants to serve more people better, faster, and smarter.
