<blockquote>Imagine being appointed to a position within city government that never existed before.
<br /><br />
Imagine that position being in America’s second largest city, 460 square miles, populated by 4 million people, employing 40,000.
<br /><br />
And now imagine that position being created to open said city’s myriad data points, so that individuals and corporations can sift through that data in order to improve the city itself.
<br /><br />
Such is the role of Abhi Nemani, LA’s first-ever Chief Data Officer. Prior to working for the city, Nemani helped run Code for America (link), a nonprofit which helps cities worldwide use tech & data to change the relationship between the city and its government.</blockquote>
