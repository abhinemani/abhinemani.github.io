<blockquote>"Abhi Nemani, the co-executive director at Code for America which connects technology professionals with city governments, echoed these concerns. The way he sees it, the current federal procurement process '[doesn't] bring in fresh new talent.' Instead, Nemani explained, 'it goes toward established vendors,” and “these are companies designed to take advantage of the system.'...<br /><br />'Procurement’s a problem,' he said, “but it’s changing.” He points to the city of Philadelphia as an ideal example, which has begun dabbling with GitHub as a way to procure technology solutions. He also cites the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a model for well-designed public-facing websites.<br /><br />'I worry that people think the government can’t build good technology,' Nemani said. 'That’s wrong, it can.'"</blockquote>
