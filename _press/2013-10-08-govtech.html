<blockquote>"Abhi Nemani, Code for America's co-executive director, says the group's initial goal was to find out what happens when you connect cities with technology. Now with the program four years in, he says Code for America is attempting to create an ecosystem of civic innovation.<br /><br />

The combination of Code for America partner cities, the tech startups incubated from the group's accelerator program and growing community involvement are what help nurture and grow the ecosystem. As the ecosystem grows, more apps and technology are developed as a result. <br /><br />

'Youâ€™re seeing the community step up to both use those tools but then also make them better,' Nemani said. <br /><br />

Nemani says Code for America must address two major issues to build a thriving civic innovation ecosystem: application sustainability and open data standards."</blockquote>
