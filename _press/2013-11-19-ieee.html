<blockquote>"The government we have doesn't always look and feel like us. I can pull up my smartphone and find out how my bank account's doing. I can find out how my favorite sports team's doing. I can do that on my phone, and that's how I’m used to interacting with things with my institutions. But I don't interact with my government that way, which means I don't feel as connected to my government, like that it’s of me, by me, for me. And that’s the change that happens when you build simple little apps."</blockquote>
