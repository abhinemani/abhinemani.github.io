<blockquote>"'When we go to investors and talk about this, part of the work we have to do is articulate what we mean by ‘civic,’ articulate that this is a space that is emerging,' says Abhi Nemani, Code for America’s director of strategy and communications. 'People don’t think of this as a space. People know health care, green tech, even social entrepreneurship.’ They don’t really know ‘civic’ yet.'... 'If we’re accomplishing what we want to do, in five or 10 years, people won’t have to ask what it means to have a civic space,' Nemani says. 'They’ll know, and they’ll be like, that’s cool. They’ll think it’s not only promising and attractive to go into, and entrepreneurs will want to do this, but they’ll see it improving their lives, and increasing the public good.'"</blockquote>
