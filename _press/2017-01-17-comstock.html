<blockquote>To build up MOFIE, Johnson tapped Abhi Nemani, a 27-year-old tech wunderkind who helped launch Code for America and served as the City of Los Angeles’ first chief data officer. Nemani, who works on a consulting basis (he lives full-time in St. Louis), started by meeting with Sacramento leaders in tech and higher education, and heard three key themes right away.<br><br>

“Folks don’t look at Sacramento as an innovation city like San Francisco or Austin, and while there is a lot of innovative stuff going on here, not a lot of people know about it,” Nemani says. Another problem: While Sacramento’s universities produce great talent, graduates aren’t staying. They  head to the Bay Area instead because they think that’s where their idea will get off the ground.<br><br>

To prevent that from happening,the Innovation and Growth Fund focuses on three goals: building a talent pipeline, drawing venture capital and investors to the area, and creating a better-connected tech community. RAILS grants are given to groups that help startups in those areas. “To create a pipeline, it’s about leadership: training and empowering people with tools to be successful,” Nemani says. “Second is innovation: getting people connected, in places like coworking spaces and maker labs. Third is acceleration: creating incubator and accelerator programs to help entrepreneurs with ideas take them to scale.” RAILS grant applicants also had to show that they have a commitment to diversity and inclusion within employee ranks, and a track record for delivering results quickly and on budget.
