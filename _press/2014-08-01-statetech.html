<blockquote>"Data has the power to transform the daily lives of L.A. residents and visitors,” Nemani said in a statement released by the city. “Knowing where your money is going, where a parking space is available and where an event is taking place puts information into the hands of those who need it most.”

	Nemani isn’t a newcomer to the government space. While at Code for America, he led the nonprofit’s product strategy, which included developing solutions to improve transparency, business licensing, food stamps and public safety for local governments, according to his LinkedIn profile. His work at Google involved developing social engagement strategies.
