<blockquote>"[Abhi Nemani] and the CfA team have held these beliefs for a while. Back in May 2011 — more than a year before the accelerator was announced — he <a href="http://mashable.com/2011/05/18/government-open-source-benefits/">told Mashable</a> about the importance of integrating tech into government: 'Leveraging technology is not just a nice or ‘cool’ thing to do — it’s critical if governments are going to cut costs while still providing core services.' Nemani says that in the next three to five years, we should see a 'real startup ecosystem for the civic space,' with entrepreneurs developing new ideas, VCs investing in them, media covering their developments and governments clamoring for more innovative ideas. 'The pieces are starting to come together, but we need more support from every sector to make that vision real,' he says.</blockquote>
