<blockquote>Nemani announced the departure internally and within his community of data scientists after 13 months of opening data sets and coordinating open data efforts across the city... he opened more than 400 data sets, bringing Los Angles' national open data ranking to No. 1. He also built a data dashboard for the mayor, worked with universities to reduce auto collision rates, and created new projects and NGOs to sustain innovation in the city.</blockquote>
